# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical issue ([#50](https://github.com/simukappu/activity_notification/issues/50)) in the activity_notification gem where background email jobs fail when notifiable models are destroyed before the mailer job executes. This commonly occurs in scenarios like "Like/Unlike" actions where users quickly toggle their actions, causing the notifiable to be destroyed while the email notification job is still queued.

The current behavior results in `Couldn't find ActivityNotification::Notification with 'id'=xyz` errors in background jobs, which can cause job failures and poor user experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using activity_notification with dependent_notifications: :destroy, I want email jobs to handle missing notifications gracefully, so that rapid create/destroy cycles don't cause background job failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a notification is destroyed before its email job executes THEN the email job SHALL complete successfully without raising an exception
2. WHEN a notification is destroyed before its email job executes THEN the job SHALL log an appropriate warning message
3. WHEN a notification is destroyed before its email job executes THEN no email SHALL be sent for that notification

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to be able to test scenarios where notifications are destroyed before email jobs execute, so that I can verify the resilient behavior works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a test that destroys a notifiable with dependent_notifications: :destroy THEN I SHALL be able to verify that queued email jobs handle the missing notification gracefully
2. WHEN I run tests for this scenario THEN the tests SHALL pass without any exceptions being raised
3. WHEN I test the resilient behavior THEN I SHALL be able to verify that appropriate logging occurs

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want background jobs to be resilient to data changes, so that temporary data inconsistencies don't cause system failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN notifications are destroyed due to dependent_notifications configuration THEN background email jobs SHALL not fail the entire job queue
2. WHEN this resilient behavior is active THEN system monitoring SHALL show successful job completion rates
3. WHEN notifications are missing THEN the system SHALL continue processing other queued jobs normally

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the fix to be backward compatible, so that existing applications using activity_notification continue to work without changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the fix is applied THEN existing notification email functionality SHALL continue to work as before
2. WHEN notifications exist and are not destroyed THEN emails SHALL be sent normally
3. WHEN the fix is applied THEN no changes to existing API or configuration SHALL be required
