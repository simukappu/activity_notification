# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves upgrading the activity_notification gem's Dynamoid dependency from the outdated v3.1.0 to the latest v3.11.0. The upgrade requires updating namespace references and method calls that have changed between these versions, while maintaining backward compatibility and ensuring all existing functionality continues to work correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using activity_notification with DynamoDB, I want the gem to support the latest Dynamoid version so that I can benefit from bug fixes, performance improvements, and security updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the gemspec is updated THEN the Dynamoid dependency SHALL be changed from development dependency '3.1.0' to runtime dependency '>= 3.11.0', '< 4.0'
2. WHEN the gem is installed THEN it SHALL successfully resolve dependencies with Dynamoid v3.11.0
3. WHEN existing applications upgrade THEN they SHALL continue to work without breaking changes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a maintainer of activity_notification, I want to update the Dynamoid extension code to use the correct namespaces and method signatures so that the gem works with the latest Dynamoid version.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension file is updated THEN all namespace references SHALL match Dynamoid v3.11.0 structure
2. WHEN Dynamoid classes are referenced THEN they SHALL use the correct module paths from v3.11.0
3. WHEN adapter plugin classes are extended THEN they SHALL use the updated class hierarchy from v3.11.0
4. WHEN the code is executed THEN it SHALL not raise any NameError or NoMethodError exceptions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using activity_notification with DynamoDB, I want all existing functionality to continue working after the Dynamoid upgrade so that my application remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the none() method is called THEN it SHALL return an empty result set as before
2. WHEN the limit() method is called THEN it SHALL properly limit query results
3. WHEN the exists?() method is called THEN it SHALL correctly determine if records exist
4. WHEN the update_all() method is called THEN it SHALL update all matching records
5. WHEN null and not_null operators are used THEN they SHALL filter records correctly
6. WHEN uniqueness validation is performed THEN it SHALL prevent duplicate records

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer running tests for activity_notification, I want all existing tests to pass with the new Dynamoid version so that I can be confident the upgrade doesn't break functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test suite is run THEN all Dynamoid-related tests SHALL pass
2. WHEN integration tests are executed THEN they SHALL work with the new Dynamoid version
3. WHEN edge cases are tested THEN they SHALL behave consistently with the previous version
4. WHEN performance tests are run THEN they SHALL show no significant regression

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a maintainer of activity_notification, I want to contribute useful enhancements back to the Dynamoid upstream project so that the broader community can benefit from the improvements we've developed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extension methods are identified as generally useful THEN they SHALL be prepared for upstream contribution
2. WHEN the none() method implementation is stable THEN it SHALL be proposed as a pull request to Dynamoid
3. WHEN the limit() method enhancement is validated THEN it SHALL be contributed to Dynamoid upstream
4. WHEN the exists?() method is proven useful THEN it SHALL be submitted to Dynamoid for inclusion
5. WHEN the update_all() method is optimized THEN it SHALL be offered as a contribution to Dynamoid
6. WHEN null/not_null operators are refined THEN they SHALL be proposed for Dynamoid core
7. WHEN uniqueness validator improvements are made THEN they SHALL be contributed upstream

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer upgrading activity_notification, I want clear documentation about the Dynamoid version change so that I can understand any potential impacts on my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CHANGELOG is updated THEN it SHALL document the Dynamoid version upgrade
2. WHEN breaking changes exist THEN they SHALL be clearly documented with migration instructions
3. WHEN new features are available THEN they SHALL be documented with usage examples
4. WHEN version compatibility is checked THEN the supported Dynamoid versions SHALL be clearly stated
5. WHEN upstream contributions are made THEN they SHALL be documented with links to pull requests
